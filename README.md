# 1. Introduction

This library is the implementation of `data-services data source` for [Lightweight Data Provider](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-lw-data-provider) (LwDP).

See more about `data-services data source` [here](https://not_implemented_yet_relates_to_TH2-4185).

# 2. Getting started

## 2.1. Installation

- From PyPI (pip)   
  This package can be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/th2-data-services-lwdp/ "th2-data-services-lwdp").
    ```
    pip install th2-data-services-lwdp
    ```

## 2.2. Releases

Each release has separate branch indicated by `DataSourceMajorVersion` of branch name.

Available versions:

## 2.3. Release versioning

Implementations versions have the following structure: `DataSourceMajorVersion`.`ImplVerison`

`DataSourceMajorVersion` - the major version of LwDP the release uses

`ImplVerison` - the version of data source implementation in `Major`.`Minor`.`Patch` versioning semantic style

For example `v1.0.1.0` is the version for LwDP `v1.x.y`. The implementation version `0.1.0`.

## Changes in LwDP 3.* against LwDP 2.*

Changes mostly affect how messages are represented in LwDP V3.

In V3 message id will also get a group section, and the new format will look like:
`book:group:session_alias:direction:timestamp:sequence`

The Main changes are in the body field of a message:
* METADATA
  * the metadata does not contain duplicated information from the top message (direction, sequence, timestamp, sessionId). Only subsequence, messageType and protocol are left (inside metadata).
  * metadata block doesn’t have fixed structure. So if there is only 1 parsed was produced from raw message, metadata will not have this key.
  * ONLY messageType is required field in metadata.

* BODY
  * The body is a collection (list) now (if the raw message produced a single parsed message, it will have only 1 element. If raw messages produced more than 1 message, all of them will be in that collection in the order they were produced).

* subsequence
  * is always list.
  * may be missing in metadata. It means [1].

Here is a small example on how to use expander to expand single message into multiple ones:

```python
from th2_data_services.data import Data
from th2_data_services.data_source.lwdp.resolver import MessageFieldResolver
# message in this example have 2 items in its body
message = {
    "timestamp":{"epochSecond":1682680778,"nano":807953000},
    "direction":"IN",
    "sessionId":"ouch_1_1",
    "attachedEventIds":[],

        {

            {   
                "subsequence":[2],
                "messageType":"OrderExecuted",
                "protocol":"protocol"
            },

}

message_data = Data([message])
mfr = MessageFieldResolver()
message_data = message_data.map(mfr.expand_message)
print(message_data) # we should now have 2 messages built from the body list of original message.
